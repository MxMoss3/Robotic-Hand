# Robotic-Hand Overview
This is the code for my senior project, building a rock, paper, scissors-playing hand. The open-source design for the 3d-printed arm comes from the [InMoov Robot](http://inmoov.fr). The fingers are actuated by 5 servos that are controlled by an arduino, powered by two 9-volt batteries in parallel. The arduino recevives commands from my computer via serial port. Main driver program is written in Python and image processing is performed using the openCV library.

You can find my final presentation of the arm [here](https://youtu.be/f7hHvrXVjak) and the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qPzilUTlk5lW5QpsaAyi3jth-C149x8M6q1rPRpe0uw)
